# How to run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you're in the project root directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Ensure that ports `5077` and `5432` are available on your computer. If they are not, please update the ports referenced in `.env`
5. Run `docker-compose up`
6. You should now be able to interact with the API via `http://localhost:5077`

# Requirements

A Customer:

[x] Has a name
-   [x] Has an email address
-   [x] Has a password
-   [x] May have zero to many Certificates

A Certificate:

-   [x] Belongs to one and only one Customer
-   [x] Can be either active or inactive
-   [x] Has a private key
-   [x] Has a certificate body

Your solution must support:

-   [x] Creating/Deleting Customers
-   [x] Creating Certificates
-   [x] Listing all of a Customerâ€™s Active Certificates
-   [x] Activating/Deactivating Certificates. If a certificate is either activated or de-activated, add the ability to notify an external system (via an HTTP post) about that fact. You could use http://httpbin.org or http://requestb.in/ to exercise this.
-   [x] Persistence (data must survive computer restarts)
